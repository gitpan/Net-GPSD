Revision history for Net::GPSD (aka GPS::gpsd before version 0.14)

2006-04-08 v0.16
  * Error in track function
    >   # Heading is measured clockwise from the North.  The angles for the math
    >   # sin and cos formulas are measured anti-clockwise from the East.  So,
    >   # in order to get this correct, we have to shift sin and cos the 90
    >   # degrees to cos and -sin.  The anti-clockwise/clockwise change flips
    >   # the sign on the sin back to positive.
    >   my $distance_lat_meters=$distance_meters * cos(deg2rad $p1->heading);
    >   my $distance_lon_meters=$distance_meters * sin(deg2rad $p1->heading);
